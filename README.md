# M1 Unlimited Router Guide

## SIM Card



### Choosing a Sim

Choosing the correct SIM card is an important step of securing good mobile internet. Your maximum data speeds will always be bounded by the connection speed of your carrier in your location. 

To setup your router, you have 2 basic options: 

<b>1) Setup ATT prepaid data plan with included SIM for use with router.  </b>  
    - flexible (no contract required)   
    - $50/month with autopay  
    - however, prepaid plans can be subject to more interruptions than postpaid contactual plans 
 
<b> 2) Use SIM card from my phone or preexisting plan, or setup new contract plan with carrier. (requires unlimited data plan) </b>  
    - no additional monthly cost  
    - howver, less convenient than dedicated data plan for router  

> NOTE: Generally, postpaid plans provide more reliable data connections than prepaid. If you already have existing lines, you may be able to add an additional line for less cost than setting up the postpaid. 

### Activation

__Setting Wifi Name and Password__

# General Troubleshooting 

## Internet is not working

1) Check internet connection on router. Open "browser" app and search google. If no internet, continue to step 2. Else, if internet is working on router but not devices, make sure your hotspot is turned on and devices are within range.   
2) If you are running VPN, try turning turning it off, and check internet connection again. If internet is now working, the problem is with VPN. Please send email to support@openinternet.cc  
3) If internet is still not working after the above troubleshooting steps, it is probably a problem with the data connection to carrier. If you are running prepaid plan, data outages can sometimes occur. Please try calling the carrier by dialing 6-1-1 on your device.
