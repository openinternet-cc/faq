## SIM Card


### Choosing a Sim

Choosing the correct SIM card is an important step of securing good mobile internet. Your maximum data speeds will always be bounded by the connection speed of your carrier in your location. 

To setup your router, you have 2 basic options:   

1) __Postpaid (Recommended for medium to long term use - more than 6 months)__

- significantly faster speed
- more reliable
- best for using as home internet solution

2) __Prepaid (Recomended for temporary/short term use - less than 6 months)__

- slower
- no contract required
- good for using as temporary option if need on month/month basis (RV trips, travel)

Use table below for plan comparison:  

|                | Postpaid         | Prepaid             |
| -----------         | -----------      | ---                 |
| Speed               |  ✅ Up to 100+ mbps   | ❌ Up to 35 mbps        |
| Cost | ✅ $55 or less per month | ✅ $50 or less per month |
| Contract  |  ❌ Requires Contract Plan   |  ✅ No Contract Required     |
| Term | 1 year minimum, then month-to-month | month-to-month |

__Turning on Wifi Hotspot__

Settings > Wifi and Hotspot > Turn on Hotspot

__Setting Wifi Name and Password__

Settings > Wifi and Hotspot > Set Wifi Username and Password


### Location in House

Before placing your router, be sure to check your baseline data speed, known as your "base speed" in that location. To do that, open your internet browser and run a simple speed test. Repeat for all possible router locations. Choose the location which provides the best base speed and is still able to reach connected devices over Wifi.

General Tips:  
- look for a central location in the house. 
- higher elevations are better (ex: upstairs > downstairs)
- check your "base speed" before placement

# General Troubleshooting 

## Internet is not working

1) Check internet connection on router. Open "browser" app and search google. If no internet, continue to step 2. Else, if internet is working on router but not devices, make sure your hotspot is turned on and devices are within range.   
2) If you are running VPN, try turning turning it off, and check internet connection again. If internet is now working, the problem is with VPN. Please send email to support@openinternet.cc  
3) If internet is still not working after the above troubleshooting steps, it is probably a problem with the data connection to carrier. If you are running prepaid plan, data outages can sometimes occur. Please try calling the carrier by dialing 6-1-1 on your device.
